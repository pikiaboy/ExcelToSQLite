# Whova technical test
Please read this README carefully as it contains all the details you need to know.



## Exercise
To complete this test, you will need to write two python scripts, as detailed below.



### Import Agenda
This program imports the schedule of an event into a local SQLite database.

To complete this task, you will need to:
1. Open an Agenda excel file
2. Design a SQLite Database table schema allowing to store agenda information
3. Parse the content of the excel file and store the content in the table you designed

We should be able to run your program as follow:
$> ./import_agenda.py agenda.xls

Please note:
* The input file will always follow the same format as the one provided in this repository.
* We do not expect any specific output.



### Lookup Agenda
This program finds agenda sessions in the data you imported.

To complete this task, you will need to:
1. Parse the command line arguments to retrieve the conditions that the sessions we are looking for must match.
2. Lookup the data you imported for the matching records
3. Print the result onto the screen

We should be able to run your program as follow:
$> ./lookup_agenda.py column value

Where:
* column can be one of {date, time_start, time_end, title, location, description, speaker}
* value is the expected value for that field

For example, if I got the following simplified rows:
Title	     Location 	  Description		    Type
===========================================================================
Breakfast    Lounge	  Fresh fruits and pastries Session
Hangout	     Beach	  Have fun		    Subsession of Breakfast
Lunch	     Price Center Junk food    	   	    Session
Dinner	     Mamma Linnas Italien handmade pasta    Session
Networking   Lounge	  Let's meet		    Subsession of Dinner

Then the expected behavior is as follow:
$> ./lookup_agenda.py location lounge
Breakfast   Lounge    	  Fresh fruits and pastries Session	  # Returned because its location is lounge 
Hangout	    Beach	  Have fun		    Subsession    # Returned because its parent session location is lounge
Networking  Lounge	  Let's meet   	   	    Subsession	  # Returned because its location is lounge

Please note:
* Your program should looks for sessions and subsessions
* If one of the matched session has any subsession, you should return all the subsessions belonging to that session as well
* We do not expect any specific output. We just want all the information about the right sessions.
* We are looking for an exact match for date, time_start, time_end, title, location and description.
* For speaker, we will only pass one name at a time. We will expect all sessions where we can find this speaker, even though he may not be the only speaker.



## Provided files
Along with this document, we do provide two important files:
* db_table.py
* agenda.xls



### db_table.py
This file provides a basic wrapper around the SQLite3 database and provides features such as:
* create table
* select
* insert
* update

These operations should be enough for this assignment, but feel free to modify if you feel the need to.

This can be used as follow:
from db_table import db_table
users = db_table("users", { "id": "integer PRIMARY KEY", "name": "text", "email": "text NOT NULL UNIQUE" })
users.insert({"name": "Simon Ninon", "email": "simon.ninon@whova.com"})
users.insert({"name": "Xinxin Jin", "email": "xinxin.jin@whova.com"})
users.insert({"name": "Congming Chen", "email": "congming.chen@whova.com"})
users.select()
users.update({'name': 'John'}, {'id':2})
users.select(['name', 'email'], {'id': 2})
users.close()

This file is very well documented, refer to it if you have any questions about how to use it.



### agenda.xls
This is the file you are supposed to import for the "Import Agenda" program.
We will always use the same format as the one you can observe in this file.
You may be interested to open this file and to read the instructions at the top of the excel sheet.



## What do we look at?
* Your code quality
* Your commits quality
* Your problem solving ability
* Your technical choices



## What can you do?
* You can use libraries
* You can create as many database tables as you want
* You can modify the provided code
* You can do more than expected if you wish to
* You can create as many files, classes, functions, ... as you want
* ...
You "can" does not mean you "must", nor does it mean we "expect".
Do what you need to do to implement your solution as long as it is relevant.
Use your own judgement.
